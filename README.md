## Data
All cleaned data are available from the [NHM Data Portal](https://doi.org/10.5519/0065209).
We were unable to upload most of the raw data to GitHub because the files are too large; however this data is mostly freely available to download as shown below.

## Analyses
The analysis code is divided into `.Rmd` files that run the analyses for each section of the paper/supplementary materials, and more detailed scripts for the figures found in the paper.

Note that throughout I've commented out `ggsave` commands so you don't clog your machine up with excess plots you don't need.

1. **01A-wrangle-data.Rmd** wrangles the specimen data into a useable format.
1. **01B-extract-overlaps.Rmd** runs overlaps models and wrangles into a useable format.
1. **01C-wrangle-overlaps-outputs.Rmd** wrangles together the overlaps and specimen details datasets.
1. **02-figure-maps.R** creates the maps of pangolin localities.
1. **03-overlaps-analyses.Rmd** gets summary stats about % overlaps.
1. **04-overlaps-analyses-models.Rmd** runs models of overlaps against various predictors.
1. **05-figures-overlaps.R** creates overlaps figures.
1. **06-extract-land-use-data.Rmd** extracts appropriate land use data from the rasters.
1. **07-land-use-analyses.Rmd** runs models of overlaps against various land use predictors.
1. **08-extract-population-data.Rmd** extracts appropriate HPD data from the rasters.
1. **09-hpd-analyses.Rmd** runs models of overlaps against various HPD predictors.
1. **10-figures-anthro.R** creates figures of anthropogenic variables.
1. **functions-anthropocene-data.R** functions to make scripts 6-10 work.

## Checkpoint for reproducibility
To rerun all the code with packages as they existed on CRAN at time of our analyses we recommend using the `checkpoint` package, and running this code prior to the analysis:

```{r}
checkpoint("2020-11-06")
```
